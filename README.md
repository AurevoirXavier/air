## Architecture
Built upon [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui), a fast and cross-platform GUI toolkit written in pure Rust.

### Components
- **Static**: These items are static and are used by other parts of the application.

### OS
- **Interaction**: Provides wrapped APIs to interact with the operating system.

### Services
- **Background Processes**: These items are time-sensitive and require frequent checking or updating. They will be spawned as separate threads and run in the background.

### State
- **Synchronization**: Mutable version of the components. Usually, they are `Arc<Mutex<Components>>` in order to sync the state between service and UI.

### UI
- **User Interface**: The user interface components.
